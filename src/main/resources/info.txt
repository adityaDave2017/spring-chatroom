rejoinRoom

Current State of Room

	test 1		 ---		session		--- 	sessionid-0
	test 2		---			session 	--- 	sessionid-1


rejoinRoom - test 1

	check if sessionId passed in request already exists or not
	if not present:
		perform joinRoom as regular
	else:
		retrieve the Viewer, and hence the session


Techniques

1. Close the previous session and link user with new sesssion	-- 	easy(backup)

2. link the user with previous session 		-- 	tough

3. the user is already present in the room, based on his/her web socket session id.
   don't allow him/her to get into it again.
